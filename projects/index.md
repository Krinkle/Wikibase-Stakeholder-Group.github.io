# Projects

The Wikibase Stakeholder Group coordinates a variety of projects--from establishing and running collaborative decision-making tools and processes; to outlining and updating institutional requirements and a roadmap for future software development; and to actively contributing with extension development for the broader Wikibase ecosystem. 

Below you will find an index of our current and ongoing projects:

- [Summary of institutional requirements for self-deployed Wikibase usage](institutional-requirements)
- [Terminology for integrating and interfacing with remote data](federation-terminology)
- Roadmap for Wikibase extensions software development (coming soon)
