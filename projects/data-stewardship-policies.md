# Data Stewardship Policies

The Wikibase Stakeholder Group surveyed its members about data management policies for Wikibase projects they're working on or are affiliated with.

In the table below policies are expressed in columns A to E, and distinguished by different abilities for "members" of a community (checkboxes in green) and "non-members" or "anyone" (checkboxes in blue). Every project has its own way of defining the boundary of its community.

The term "outside repository" is used from the perspective of a Wikibase project for any linked open data repository that is not stewarded by the project. This includes, but it not limited to, Wikidata.

This survey data might be updated in the future.

If a project spans two columns, it either has parts of both or is currently using one policy but moving towards another. In the survey data presented, all projects that want to further develop their policies are moving towards policy **C**.

The result shows a strong bias towards cases **B** and **C**, in which communities create and publicly share data. Half of these projects are using remote public data to offer users of their system more information gathered from outside resources.
