# Data Stewardship Matrix

The Wikibase Stakeholder Group surveyed its members about data management policies for Wikibase projects they're working on or are affiliated with.

The table below distinguishes different abilities for "members" of a community (checkboxes in green) and "non-members" or "anyone" (checkboxes in blue). Every project has its own way of defining the boundary of its community.

The term "outside repository" is used from the perspective of a Wikibase project for any linked open data repositor that is not stewarded by the project. This includes, but it not limited to, Wikidata.

The result shows a strong bias towards cases **B** and **C**, in which communities create and publicly share data. Half of these projects are using remote public data to offer users of their system more information.

This survey data might be updated in the future.
